title: Deploy the relay
description: Run the Weft relay next to your organisation's peers so browsers can reach the Fabric Gateway.
---

Browsers can't speak Fabric's gRPC protocol, so each organisation runs a small HTTP **relay** next to its peers. It uses the official `@hyperledger/fabric-gateway` SDK in offline-signing mode:

1. The relay builds an unsigned proposal for the wallet's certificate.
2. The wallet checks it, signs it, and sends the signature back.
3. The relay forwards the signed message to the peer's Gateway service, and repeats for the transaction and its commit status.

The relay **never holds private keys** and keeps **no state** between requests, so you can run as many replicas as you like behind a load balancer.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WEFT_PEER_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Peer Gateway address, e.g. `peer0.org1.example.com:7051`. |
| `WEFT_PEER_TLS_CA_CERT` | For TLS | Path to the PEM of the CA that signed the peer's TLS certificate. Omit only for plaintext dev networks. |
| `WEFT_PEER_HOST_ALIAS` | No | TLS server name to expect, when the endpoint is an IP or tunnel. |
| `WEFT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated browser origins allowed by CORS. Default `*`. |
| `WEFT_ALLOWED_MSP_IDS` | No | Refuse signers from any other MSP. Recommended. |
| `WEFT_MAX_GATEWAYS` | No | Cached connections, one per signer. Default `256`. |
| `PORT` | No | Default `8787`. |

## Run it

With Node 22:

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm build
WEFT_PEER_ENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 \
WEFT_PEER_TLS_CA_CERT=/etc/weft/peer-tls-ca.pem \
WEFT_ALLOWED_MSP_IDS=Org1MSP \
pnpm --filter @weft/relay start
```

With Docker, from the repository root:

```sh
docker build -f apps/relay/Dockerfile -t weft-relay .
docker run -p 8787:8787 \
  -e WEFT_PEER_ENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 \
  -e WEFT_PEER_TLS_CA_CERT=/certs/ca.pem \
  -v /path/to/peer-tls:/certs:ro \
  weft-relay
```

Put it behind your usual TLS-terminating proxy: users' wallets must reach it over HTTPS.

## API

All bodies are JSON; byte fields are base64. The wallet calls these in order; you won't call them yourself.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/health` | Liveness. |
| `POST /v1/proposals` | Build an unsigned proposal for `{ signer, call }`. |
| `POST /v1/proposals/evaluate` | Evaluate a signed proposal on one peer. |
| `POST /v1/proposals/endorse` | Collect endorsements; returns the unsigned transaction. |
| `POST /v1/transactions/submit` | Submit a signed transaction to ordering. |
| `POST /v1/commits/status` | Wait for the signed commit-status request; returns the validation code. |

Errors are `{ "error": { "kind", "message", "details": [{ "mspId", "address", "message" }] } }`, with `details` carrying each peer's response for endorsement failures.

## What the relay can and can't do

- It sees transaction contents, as your peers do. Run it inside the same trust boundary.
- It **cannot** sign as a user. A tampered relay could try to get a user to sign something else, which is why the wallet decodes and checks every message before signing. See the [security model](/reference/security/).
