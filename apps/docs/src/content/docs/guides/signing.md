title: Reading a signature request
description: What each part of Weft's approval window means, and what to check before you sign.
---

When an app asks Weft to sign, a window opens with everything you need to decide.

## Read or write?

The coloured banner at the top is the most important part.

- **EVALUATE** (teal): a read-only query. It asks one peer to run the function and return the result. Nothing is written to the ledger and nothing is shared with other organisations' ledgers. The button says **Sign & query**.
- **SUBMIT** (amber): a write. The request goes to the organisations the contract's endorsement policy requires; if they agree, it is ordered into a block and committed. Once committed it cannot be undone. The button says **Sign & submit**.

## The details

| Field | What to check |
|---|---|
| Site | The address of the app asking. Make sure it's the one you expect. |
| Signing as | Which of your identities will sign. Switch identities from the home screen before approving if needed. |
| Channel | Which shared ledger this touches. |
| Contract | The chaincode, and the contract inside it when the chaincode has several. |
| Function | What the contract will do, e.g. `TransferAsset`. |
| Arguments | The inputs, in order, decoded into text. |
| Private | Names of private (transient) inputs. Their values are not shown and never reach the ledger. |

**View raw request** shows the same information as JSON, which is useful when reporting a problem.

## What Weft checks for you

The relay builds the actual Fabric messages. Before signing each one, Weft decodes it and confirms the channel, contract, function, every argument, the private input names and your certificate match what you approved. If anything differs, Weft refuses to sign and records why. See the [security model](/reference/security/).

## After you approve

For a submit, Weft signs three times in a row: the proposal, the endorsed transaction, and the request for its commit status. You only approve once. The window shows **Committed** when the block is written, or an explanation if it fails: see [When a transaction fails](/guides/failures/).

Closing the window counts as **Reject**.
